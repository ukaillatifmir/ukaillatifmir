### Hi there 👋

<!--
**ukaillatifmir/ukaillatifmir** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
#   
#   In this project I have used default db sqlite but if you 
    Want to use mysql , the code is already written ✍️ in setting.Py 
    file you can uncommit it. 
#   In this assignment I have added some additional features like Business card. 
#   In this project we have 2 modules user and admin. 
    In user module user can see the uploaded posts. But can't upload 
    Post without the registration. 
#   After user got registered we have provided him some additional features like upload 
    post, make business card 💳 .
